# AOC 2022 Started

Aaaand here we go again - Advent of Code 2022 started and we are back in action with the christmas elves. This year we have to collect stars - a very delicious type of food for reindeers. Follow along on my journey starting with [Day1]({{< ref "/posts/day1" >}} "Day 1")! And as last year my language of choice again is Golang. Maybe i get the chance to try out the new Generics!

Happy coding!
